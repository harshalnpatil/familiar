Familiar turns everything on your screen and clipboard into context for your existing AI.

Free, open source, and offline. Nothing leaves your machine.

## Website

**[lookfamiliar.org](https://lookfamiliar.org)**

## Installation

1. Open the [releases page](https://github.com/familiar-software/familiar/releases)
2. Download the latest `.dmg`:
   - `arm64` for Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3/M4)
   - `x64` for Intel Macs
3. Open the installer and move `Familiar.app` to `Applications`.
4. Launch Familiar and complete setup in Settings.

## Where Familiar writes data

- Settings: `~/.familiar/settings.json`
- Captured still images: `<contextFolderPath>/familiar/stills/`
- Clipboard image mirrors while recording: `<contextFolderPath>/familiar/stills/<sessionId>/<timestamp>.clipboard.<ext>`
- Extracted markdown (including OCR output for clipboard images): `<contextFolderPath>/familiar/stills-markdown/`
- Clipboard text mirrors while recording: `<contextFolderPath>/familiar/stills-markdown/<sessionId>/<timestamp>.clipboard.txt`
- Before still markdown and clipboard text are written, Familiar runs `rg`-based redaction for password/API-key patterns. If the scanner fails twice, Familiar still saves the file and shows a one-time warning toast per recording session.

## Build locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/familiar-software/familiar.git
cd familiar/code/desktopapp
npm install
npm start
```

Create local macOS build artifacts:

```bash
npm run dist:mac
```

`npm run dist:mac*` includes `npm run build:rg-bundle`, which prepares `code/desktopapp/scripts/bin/rg/*` and packages it into Electron resources at `resources/rg/`.

`build-rg-bundle.sh` downloads official ripgrep binaries when missing (or copies from `FAMILIAR_RG_DARWIN_ARM64_SOURCE` / `FAMILIAR_RG_DARWIN_X64_SOURCE` if provided). The binaries are generated locally and are not committed.

## Contributing

### Microcopy source of truth

- User-facing app microcopy is centralized in `src/microcopy/index.js`.
- Update copy there instead of editing scattered strings across tray/dashboard modules.

For development contributions:

```bash
npm test
npm run test:unit:timed
npm run test:modelProviderTests
npm run test:e2e
```

Open a PR with a clear description, tests for behavior changes, and any relevant README/docs updates.
